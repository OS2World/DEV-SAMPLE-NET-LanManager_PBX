# DEV-SAMPLE-NET-LanManager_PBX
LAN Manager "PBX" service from MSJV6-1 which demonstrates how to build a peer-peer comm session using Named Pipes.

PBX is general purpose, named-pipe packet router designed to support virtual, named-pipe, peer-to-peer connections.  These connections are virtual because all communications are through the PBX Service.  However, they appear as a peer-to-peer named-pipe connection to the clients (once a connection is established). PBX performs this using a quick, protocol-unaware method and may, therefore, be used by several clients each of which supports its own internal protocol.
